# Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Regression, Classification, Clustering.

This notebook investigates the use of machine learning tools and how we can predict the price of Airbnb’s within the city of New York and the surrounding area. Specifically, the algorithms being implemented within this notebook are Regression, Classification, and Clustering in which we preview both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The main objective is to understand the prediction of price within the New York vicinity looking directly at Airbnb’s. Due to the nature of the dataset, we were only able to use prediction techniques however, manipulating data in order to implement further algorithms on the dataset to process clustering and classification techniques which can be showcased.
